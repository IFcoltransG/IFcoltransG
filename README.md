### Season's greetings!
I'm IFcoltransG â€” which I'm sure y'all'd've figured out by now. I'm interested in the intersection between how humans and computers assign meaning to symbols, the space partway between poem and programme. Pronouns are [they/them](https://pronoun.is/they), please. I know far too much about Python, Shakespeare and superseded science for my own good.

I'd tell you what I've made recently, but it'd only grow out of sync with my pinned repos.

Currently in progress, last I updated this: *Imperial*, a programming language; *Tarot*, a programming language; *Spotify Annotator*, a web tool; *Furlong*, an editor bookmarklet; and *world peace*, a dream.

If you need to contact me, feel free to do it over GitHub. If I don't respond and it's urgent, wait a few days and try again. I'm also elsewhere, mostly with the same username. You get bonus points if you know what it means.

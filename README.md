### Season's greetings! ⛅

I'm IFcoltransG — which I'm sure y'all'd've figured out by now. I work on several projects at a time, but check out my pinned repos below for some of the most interesting ones.

The projects that excite me are often game dev, coding language design, or tooling for the technologies I love (such as Rust, Ink and WebAssembly). You can also read my writing-related repos, such as technical guides, wiki websites and poetry.
